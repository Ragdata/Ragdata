These past couple of months, I've felt like a kid in a candy store ...

You see, a couple of months ago my 23+ year career in the corporate world came to a screaming halt thanks to COVID. Sure, I was kinda bummed for a couple of weeks, but then I realised that I had actually been handed an opportunity. So, I spent most of my severance on setting up a company of my own, and I've been thinking very hard about the projects that I want to work on moving forward.

So far, I've settled on the [**ISPConfig Web Hosting Control Panel**](https://www.ispconfig.org/), and the [**GRAV flat-file CMS**](https://getgrav.org/). As far as I'm concerned, they're two very exciting products that dont get nearly the attention they deserve. So, I'm going to be spending the next several months / years devoting my efforts to building up a collection of addons and complimentary products to support - what I think - are very worthy projects.

My current projects are:

- The [**ISPC-Kit Monorep**](https://github.com/Ragdata/ispc-monorepo)
  - A collection of packages centered around the [ISPC-Kit Server Setup Suite](https://github.com/Ragdata/ispc-kit) which allows you to start with a fresh install of Ubuntu-20.04 and build a world-class hosting appliance PACKED with some of the best Open Source products available today!

- The [**BashBits Function Library**](https://github.com/Ragdata/bash-bits)
  - While building `ISPC-Kit` - which was really the first time I had attempted to use Bash in any meaningful kind of way - I realised that Bash had really come of age and was quite a formiddable scripting language in its own right now. Most of the elements of `BashBits` started out as library files within `ISPC-Kit`, but I figured I could polish them up a little bit and turn them into a kind of pseudo-framework for my future Bash 'applications'. -->
