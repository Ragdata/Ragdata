These past several months, I've felt like a kid in a candy store ...

About 2 years ago now, my 25 year career in the corporate world came to a screaming halt thanks to COVID.  Sure, I was kinda bummed for a couple of weeks, but then I realised that I had actually been handed an opportunity.  So, I spent most of my severance on setting up a company of my own, and I launched myself at a few projects I've been wanting to get my teeth into for YEARS now.

The big one that I'm building up to is the [RedEyed-RPG Project][redeyed-rpg], which is the culmination of several months worth of work - not to mention an attempt to turn my life-long love of Table-Top Role Playing Games into something more than a hobby! 

# UPDATE: 15 November 2022

[//]: # (## Announcing the `Swarm-Kit` Project)

## üéâ Projects are ACTUALLY starting to come online!!

Here's what I've got ready for you so far:

#### üìÑ [**.dotfiles**][dotfiles]

The `.dotfiles` project is actually a copy of MY personal dotfiles that I use on my WSL and other Linux instances.  Here, you'll find a well-developed library of aliases, functions, and some extra-special functionality that you don't normally see included in these kinds of things (I'm going to make you head over to the repo to find out what that is though) ...

<br>

#### üìò [**Linux Snippets**][linux-snippets]

My `Snippets' series' will hopefully become quite an extensive collection of hints, tips, and how-to's covering all of the most important topics you need to know when managing computer systems and networks as more than a casual user.  I'm starting with Linux, but will hopefully expand out to include Windows, and maybe even other platforms as time goes on ...

<br>

#### :octocat: Examples of GitHub "Utility" Repos

Each of these is a special kind of repository that GitHub deals with a little differently from all other repositories you might create.  I'll try and make the documentation for these as complete as possible so that you can use them as guides for building your own:

- [**.github**][github]
  - If you create a .github repo under your personal or organisation repositories, it will provide certain files by default to ALL other repositories owned by you or your organisation which don't have their own versions.  Of course, if a repo has its own copies of these files, then THOSE are the ones which will be made active for that repository.  This is great for helping to implement organisation-wide policies and procedures.

<br>

- [**Ragdata**][ragdata]
  - When you build a repository which has _exactly_ the same name as the user or organisation above it, then the `README.md` file that you put in this repo will appear as the "overview" text for that organisation or user.  If you check it out, you'll see that it's actually the file I created to give you THIS information!

<br>

- [**Ragdata.github.io**][github-pages]
  - This repository is set up as my GitHub User Account Website and while admittedly there's not a lot going on there at the moment, the reason I really set this up was to give you an idea of how to set up your own [GitHub Pages User Website][github-site].  Your GitHub Membership grants you one website per user account, and one more site per organization - but then you get to create as many project sites as you like - one for every repo if you want!

<br>

#### üèÜ [The Project Badges Project][project-badges]

Last, but certainly not least is a tongue-in-cheek documentation project I started quite some time ago and STILL haven't done anything with which pokes a bit of fun at our obsession with those colourful little badges we all love to plaster all over our README files, and includes a small homage to the guys who actually started the craze.

These past couple of months, I've felt like a kid in a candy store ...

You see, a couple of months ago my 23+ year career in the corporate world came to a screaming halt thanks to COVID. Sure, I was kinda bummed for a couple of weeks, but then I realised that I had actually been handed an opportunity. So, I spent most of my severance on setting up a company of my own, and I've been thinking very hard about the projects that I want to work on moving forward.

So far, I've settled on the [**ISPConfig Web Hosting Control Panel**](https://www.ispconfig.org/), and the [**GRAV flat-file CMS**](https://getgrav.org/). As far as I'm concerned, they're two very exciting products that dont get nearly the attention they deserve. So, I'm going to be spending the next several months / years devoting my efforts to building up a collection of addons and complimentary products to support - what I think - are very worthy projects.

My current projects are:

- The [**ISPC-Kit Monorep**](https://github.com/Ragdata/ispc-monorepo)
  - A collection of packages centered around the [ISPC-Kit Server Setup Suite](https://github.com/Ragdata/ispc-kit) which allows you to start with a fresh install of Ubuntu-20.04 and build a world-class hosting appliance PACKED with some of the best Open Source products available today!

- The [**BashBits Function Library**](https://github.com/Ragdata/bash-bits)
  - While building `ISPC-Kit` - which was really the first time I had attempted to use Bash in any meaningful kind of way - I realised that Bash had really come of age and was quite a formiddable scripting language in its own right now. Most of the elements of `BashBits` started out as library files within `ISPC-Kit`, but I figured I could polish them up a little bit and turn them into a kind of pseudo-framework for my future Bash 'applications'. -->
